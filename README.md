# Graphical Password Authentication

Graphical Password Authentication is a type of authentication method that allows users to select a combination of images or symbols as their password instead of a traditional text-based password. This method offers several advantages over text-based passwords, including improved memorability and better resistance against dictionary attacks.

### How it Works
Graphical Password Authentication works by presenting users with a set of images or symbols and allowing them to select a combination of these to form their password. The images or symbols can be arranged in a variety of ways, such as a grid or a circle, and users can choose the order in which they select them. Once users have selected their password, they can use it to log in to their account.

### Installation
There are many Graphical Password Authentication systems available, both commercial and open-source. To install an open-source system, follow these steps:

Download the system from the project's website or repository.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Configure the system according to the documentation provided.
Test the system to ensure that it is working correctly.

### Usage
To use a Graphical Password Authentication system, follow these steps:

Enter your username and select the "Graphical Password" option.
Select the images or symbols that make up your password.
Submit your password to log in to your account.
